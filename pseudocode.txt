*Next Feature to Build -

Reset Board:
1. I need to find a way to regenerate the images in my table.
2. Need to append an image to a <td> element. There is a DOM manipulation for that. Must google it/read class notes.
3. image but also be assigned a new "name" class which is assignable AND a be assigned the class ".clickable"
4. image must also have a src.

div image = create <img>
        give name =*student name matching image*
        give class = clickable
        give scratchpad
    append img (to td, to tr? Let's see about that one? )  ===

    use "setAttribute?"

Okay. Reset. Bronze level previously stated is actually a silver, perhaps. Must start smaller:
1. name my pictures (img elements)
2. name my sidebar names (divs)
3. make them clickable.
4. see if I can store that data and compare it.
5. if it matches - win!
6. if it doesn't - lose!
7. when it's over? STOP.

Initial Goal:
  Create a memory game that asks the user to match my cohorts photos with their names.

  Bronze Level Goal: using a 9 by 9 table or div selection, generate a selection of photos of my cohort-mates and use a sidebar with their names. Have the "player" flip over a card and then see a picture of a person.
  Press a button and match the name. If the name matches, player wins that round. If not, they lose.

  Silver Level Goal: Add more people, have them animated perhaps, add fun facts that also match up with the photos.

  Gold Level Goal: fully automated, add random generate button, visually appealing. *** come back to this.
