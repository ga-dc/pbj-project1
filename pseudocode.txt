There is a Branch called UndoHardCode. 

This has been a journey. I didn’t know where to start. Have some real room to grow on how to “think small” - I learned that the best way I learn is in talking to my cohort people and the coolest thing was that after I felt beyond frustrated, I asked my group leader/hero for help and then, with what I learned, I went around to other people who looked like they were about to fall apart or were otherwise stressing out and I helped them calm down just like I was helped. 

For my next move on this project, I would like to remove the hardcode from my Html and put the array values in my JS. I know how to do that and in this other branch I even created a randomize function but I don’t know how to generate it into my “innerHTML”/button. 

I wanted, someday, to shrink the table to the original 9x9 and then randomly generate the photos but I have to learn more about the append function to do that. That is where I am least comfortable.

*Next Feature to Build -

Reset Board:
1. I need to find a way to regenerate the images in my table.
2. Need to append an image to a <td> element. There is a DOM manipulation for that. Must google it/read class notes.
3. image but also be assigned a new "name" class which is assignable AND a be assigned the class ".clickable"
4. image must also have a src.

div image = create <img>
        give name =*student name matching image*
        give class = clickable
        give scratchpad
    append img (to td, to tr? Let's see about that one? )  ===

    use "setAttribute?"

Okay. Reset. Bronze level previously stated is actually a silver, perhaps. Must start smaller:
1. name my pictures (img elements)
2. name my sidebar names (divs)
3. make them clickable.
4. see if I can store that data and compare it.
5. if it matches - win!
6. if it doesn't - lose!
7. when it's over? STOP.
8* reset button

Initial Goal:
  Create a memory game that asks the user to match my cohorts photos with their names.

  Bronze Level Goal: using a 9 by 9 table or div selection, generate a selection of photos of my cohort-mates and use a sidebar with their names. Have the "player" flip over a card and then see a picture of a person.
  Press a button and match the name. If the name matches, player wins that round. If not, they lose.

  Silver Level Goal: Add more people, have them animated perhaps, add fun facts that also match up with the photos.

  Gold Level Goal: fully automated, add random generate button, visually appealing. *** come back to this.
