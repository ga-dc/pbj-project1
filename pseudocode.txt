Initial Goal:
  Create a memory game that asks the user to match my cohorts photos with their names.

  Bronze Level Goal: using a 9 by 9 table or div selection, generate a selection of photos of my cohort-mates and use a sidebar with their names. Have the "player" flip over a card and then see a picture of a person.
  Press a button and match the name. If the name matches, player wins that round. If not, they lose.

  Silver Level Goal: Add more people, have them animated perhaps, add fun facts that also match up with the photos.

  Gold Level Goal: fully automated, add random generate button, visually appealing. *** come back to this.

  =================

  Okay. Reset. Bronze level above is actually a silver, perhaps. Must start smaller:
1. name my pictures (img elements)
2. name my sidebar names (divs)
3. make them clickable.
4. see if I can store that data and compare it.
5. if it matches - win! 
6. if it doesn't - lose!
7. when it's over? STOP.
8* reset button
