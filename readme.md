Hi there! Welcome to WDI8! I suck at remembering all of your names and I think you do too! (Let's be real...) But never fear! IF YOU DO this little game here will be something you might actually use!

*** How to Play: Couldn't be easier!


Pick a face and match the name! All you do is click! If you are right, the game confirms it. If you are wrong, you'll know! Name or face, face or name - put two and two together and make sure you don't embarrass yourself when you need to beg Carol for her help perfecting your CSS only to find out her name is Caitlin and you've been calling her Carol for weeks now. Never again!

This is my first project connecting JavaScript to CSS and HTML. It's not terrible for a first timer but there are certainly things I'd like to improve upon. That being said, I'm pretty proud I was able to use Scope to my advantage. By declaring the value of two key "click counting" variable in the global scope I was able to create a function which depended on the scope of "this" and an "event listener" to redefine "firstGuess" and "secondGuess" as the function moved down the call list. Finally, we simply took advantage of the way JS reads a page and we reset the global variables in a narrower scope which would then reset the counter and allow the eventListener to initiate it's game-playing function over and over again.



In the near future I'd like to see: (User Stories)
1. As a user, I'd like the buttons and photos to highlight more clearly so I can see my choices more clearly when I make a match.

2. As a User, I'd like the photos to randomize and maybe the names too, that way I don't have to scroll down so far. It would make it more of a game.

3. As a User, I would like the data inside the buttons and the photos to be inter-changeable so that I could use this code for new offices, new meetings, etc. It would even be cool if someday it could collect people's Facebook or linkedIn pictures for phone contacts.

4. As a user, I'd like there to be more of a reward when I get a right answer, so it would be more engaging, more like a game.

5. As a user, I'd like to have a smaller table and a button to reset the page so that it would not be visually overwhelming.
